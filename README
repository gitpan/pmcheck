pmcheck version 1.1

Recursively extract package information from all readable non-empty regular
text files in the source tree.  The current directory is used if no directory
or file is specified.  All dot-files and directories are ignored.

If the --provided option is given, shows all packages provided by .pm files
in the source tree.  Otherwise shows all packages required by .cgi, .pl, .pm
and .t files that are not provided anywhere in the source tree (and also
nowhere in @INC if the --missing option is given).  Files with no dot in the
name are also checked if they start with a perl shebang line.

NOTE: Packages required by the 'use base' and 'use parent' pragmas and by the
Moose 'extends' and 'with' functions will only be included if Module::Used is
available.  Will display an activity indicator if run interactively and
Term::Activity is available.
